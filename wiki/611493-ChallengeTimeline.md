### **Training Data availability**

Register for this year's challenge Task 1 and then fill out this [google form](https://forms.gle/FRabNXU3LL5trypm9), to get access to the skull-stripped, and annotated training data.

### **Validation Data availability**

An independent set of validation scans will be made available to the participants, with the intention to allow them assess the generalizability of their methods in unseen data, via the evaluation platform. At this point a public leaderboard will also be made available.

### **Short Paper submission deadline**

Participants will have to evaluate their methods on the training and validation datasets, and submit their short paper (8-10 LNCS pages â€” together with the "LNCS Consent to Publish" form), describing their segmentation method and results. The paper submission is expected at the BrainLes CMT submission system, after choosing BRATS as the "Track". Please ensure that you include the appropriate citations, mentioned at the bottom of the "Data" section. This unified scheme should allow for appropriate preliminary comparisons and the creation of the MICCAI BrainLes conference proceedings. Participants are allowed to submit longer papers to the MICCAI 2021 BrainLes Workshop, by choosing "BrainLes" as the "Track". BraTS papers will be part of the BrainLes workshop proceedings distributed by Springer LNCS. All paper submissions should use the LNCS template, available both in LaTeX and in MS Word format, directly from Springer.

### **Oral Presentations at MICCAI**

The top-ranked participants of the validation phase that have also submitted a short paper, will be contacted to prepare slides for orally presenting their method during the BraTS session in MICCAI 2021.

### **Final ranking phase**

The BraTS 2021 test scans will not be made available to the participating teams. Participants will need to submit their method in a containerized form (more details will follow up soon) to be evaluated on the validation and the hidden testing data.

### **Announcement of Final Results**

Ranking and final results of the challenge will be reported during the BraTS'21 challenge, which will run as part of the Annual Scientific Meeting of the RSNA 2021 .

### **Post-conference LNCS paper**

All participated methods will be invited to extend their papers to 11-14 pages for inclusion to the LNCS proceedings of the BrainLes Workshop.

### **Joint post-conference journal paper**

All participating teams will be involved to the joint manuscript summarizing the results of RSNA/ASNR/MICCAI BraTS 2021, that will be submitted to a high-impact journal in the field after the conclusion of the challenge at RSNA 2021.
