#Overview
The Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge celebrates its 10th anniversary, and this year is jointly organized by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR), and the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) society.

The RSNA/ASNR/MICCAI BraTS 2021 challenge utilizes multi-institutional multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, and focuses on (Task 1) the evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of intrinsically heterogeneous brain glioblastoma sub-regions in mpMRI scans. Furthemore, to pinpoint the clinical relevance of this segmentation task, BraTSâ€™21 also focuses on (Task 2) the evaluation of methods to predict the MGMT promoter methylation status at the pre-operative baseline scans, via integrative analyses of quantitative imaging phenomic features and machine learning algorithms.
