> ### Deadline for short paper submission is August 13

## **1.  Writing and Submitting Short Papers**

Participants will have to submit a short paper (8-10 LNCS pages â€” together with the [LNCS Consent to Publish](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/15433008/data/Contract_Book_Contributor_Consent_to_Publish_LNCS_SIP) form), describing their segmentation method and results. 

Submit your paper to the [BrainLes CMT submission system](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/User/Login?ReturnUrl=%2FBrainLes2021%2F), and make sure you choose BRATS as the "Track". Please ensure that you include the appropriate citations, mentioned at the bottom of the [Challenge Data](#!Synapse:syn25829070/wiki/610873) page in the "Conditions for Use" section. This unified scheme should allow for appropriate preliminary comparisons and the creation of the MICCAI BrainLes conference proceedings. Participants are allowed to submit longer papers to the MICCAI 2021 BrainLes Workshop, by choosing "BrainLes" as the "Track". BraTS papers will be part of the BrainLes workshop proceedings distributed by Springer LNCS. All paper submissions should use the LNCS template, available both in LaTeX and in MS Word format, directly from Springer ([link here](https://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)).
